<h1>Welcome to the Persuasive Design</h1>

<p>This site explores how psychological and neuroscience principles can guide better user experience and digital design. It focuses heavily on proven research and concrete examples of the concepts in digital format.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> The site is very much in draft beta mode. You are in danger of coming across spelling errors, grammar issues, and possibly even incomplete sentences. If this doesn't scare you away, then look around! There is great information here that might help you out.</p>

<p>As you look over the site, you can help me out. Leave a comment and maybe even an example of a site that makes good use of the concept, or perhaps even a site that could make better use of it. I'm always on the lookout for more/better examples â€” I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
