                    <p>Optimism bias is the tendency for people to believe that they are less likely to experience negative events and more likely to experience positive outcomes. It’s a cognitive bias where individuals expect things to go well, often overlooking potential risks or challenges.This tendency encourages confidence but can sometimes lead to being overly hopeful about an outcome and therefore may cause the user to overlook potential negative outcomes.</p>

                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>Optimism bias is a common tendency that has impacted all of us at one time or another. If you've ever encountered a disappointing result and, looking back, it seems that some fairly obvious steps might have avoided this situation, you have been the victim of optimism bias. Most students will at one time or another wonder why they thought they were better prepared for a test than their grades might reflect. We probably all have examples of situations in which we have paid a price for being unrealistically optimistic.
                    <p>
                    <p>Neil Weinstein conducted <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=8ea252384f36afdfc4ff6d5c3786aa6afcb5db6bz" target="_blank">a major study in 1980</a> that demonstrated the tendency of individuals to believe that they are less likely to experience negative events (such as illness or accidents) and more likely to experience positive events (such as good health or success) compared to others. He noted in a second study that people "are unrealistically optimistic because they focus on factors that improve their own chances of achieving desirable outcomes" and fail to consider the factors that may instead cause failures. Because optimism bias leads us to believe that success is pretty much "in the bag," so to speak, it causes us to miss or even ignore signs that more needs to be done.
                    <p>
                    <p>Digitally, we fall into this trap often simply by not looking at the flow from the user's point of view. Medlin, rewrite the rest of this-->I can describe from experience a situation with a group that provided auto loans. We were trying to solve a common problem in this field, specifically that approved customers often did not get the loans. This could be for many reasons that go beyond the digital design, but our focus was on the changes within our digital purview. In looking at the screenshots, a potential problem became clear. The approval screen had all the right elements: a notice of approval, pleasing text and font color, a bright picture of a big truck on a mountainside, and below instructions to select the loan term. The selection of the loan term will determine the final rate, which will be different for say a 36 or 48 or any other section of months for the loan term. There were two issues here. First, the loan term selection was all "below the fold" or not shown in the initial page load. This alone would not have been a problem since most pages have content that does not fit on the initial page load. The real problem here was that the design inadvertently cut off right below the graphic, with no indication that there was more content to be viewed. It looked initially to the user that it was simply a confirmation screen like any other and the message that "You're approved!" Sophisticated users might know that a loan term was needed and wonder where the selection was to be made. But newer users--and maybe even some more experienced users--could easily be sidelined by optimism bias. They saw what they were hoping for--an exciting message of approval and a "big honkin' truck" (as I called it) that pushed the needed content below the fold.
                    <p>
                    <p>An important note here is that people were still not convinced. Even designers dismissed the idea, feeling certain that surely people know to scroll. But AB testing bore it out. As Weinstein alluded to in his study, factors that contributed to the optimistic result that people wanted to see--in this case a successful conclusion to the application--kept some users from even looking to see that the important last step still needed to be completed.</p>
                    </p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Ensure key actions are clearly visible.</strong> Important steps should never be hidden "below the fold" without clear visual cues that additional action is required.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use explicit progress indicators.</strong> A clear, step-by-step progress bar helps users understand exactly where they are in a process and what remains to be done.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reinforce next steps with clear messaging.</strong> Instead of assuming users will seek out additional steps, use prominent calls to action and instructional cues to guide them forward.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leverage user testing and data.</strong> A/B testing can reveal where optimism bias may be causing drop-off points, allowing for iterative design improvements that ensure users complete critical steps.</li>
                        <p>By addressing optimism bias in digital applications, we can create more effective user experiences that prevent premature disengagement and improve overall process completion.</p>

                <h2>Non-Committal Verbiage</h2>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>Non-committal verbiage refers to language that avoids the feel of obligation. It involves using words or phrases that don't fully commit to following a specific path. Examples of non-committal verbiage include phrases like “Get Started” rather than “Apply Now.” Committal verbiage conveys the feel or impression--real or imagined--that the user may be somehow locked in to a given path. Non-committal verbiage avoids any subtle or implied message of obligation. </p>
                    <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Makes actions feel exploratory rather than binding</li>
                        <li>Committal language can convey the perception of obligation, which can feel like a loss of options</li>
                        <li>Reducing perceived commitment can make the user feel more comfortable with the process, and more likely to proceed</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>As the old saying goes, words matter. Dr. Youyou Wu would certainly say so. She ran a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418680112" target="_blank">a study to on Facebook posts</a> to determine how closely she could measure a person's personality traits based on the content of the posts that were liked by the participants. The results were both fascinating and some combination of scary and creepy. Dr. Wu found that the analysis program could evaluate the participants personality type better than actual humans in the participants' social circles. It only took 10 posts to gage a person's personality better than coworkers at the participants' offices were able to do. With 70 posts, the algorithm was able to beat the assessments of the participants' close friends or roommates. At the range of 250-300 posts, the algorithm is more accurate than a participants' own spouses.</p>
                    <p>More to the point here, people often experience resistance to language that conveys the perception of a tone of command. We can feel a loss of control and an almost subconscious resistance. There's a lot of studies on this with public service messaging. For example, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1977-01216-001" target="_blank">a study by Pennebaker and Sanders</a> tested a strongly worded command to not write graffiti in a bathroom versus an alternative of asking users to "please" not write graffiti. The commanding verbiage resulted in significantly more (italicize) graffiti than the non-committal request. In a similar <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00461.x" target="_blank">In a similar study by Bensley and Wu</a> on messages to reduce drinking, they also found that the softer or neutral wording in the test messages were significantly more effective in curbing excess drinking than the more strongly worded messages.
                    <p> </p> The example I gave above in the definition is from actual testing I did on this concept. AB testing several products, the non-committal verbiage beat things like "Apply Now" and other similar Call to Action (CTA) content by a significant margin. The results were remarkably consistent. "Apply Now" implies both a command (tone) and that user is expected to complete the application (loss of choice). "Get Started" is softer (more neutral tone), and leaves the question of completion to the user (more choice). 

In another test on a membership flow, the standard committal CTA verbiage "Join Now" was tested against the softer verbiage "Check Eligibility." In this study, the softer verbiage increased clicks to the informational page by 10%, and clicks into the actual membership flow were up by 5% over control--phenomenal results for a simple change to the start button.

This is an easy change to make and I guarantee it will have an impact. </p>
                    </p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Use softer, open-ended calls to action (CTAs).</strong> Replace high-commitment phrases like "Apply Now" with "Get Started" or "Learn More" to encourage users to engage without feeling locked in.</li>
                        <li><strong>Avoid authoritative or commanding language.</strong> Strongly worded instructions can create psychological resistance. Instead, use neutral or inviting language to guide users through the process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Frame actions as user-driven choices.</strong> Emphasizing autonomy—such as “Explore Options” rather than “Choose Now”—can increase user comfort and willingness to proceed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leverage A/B testing to refine messaging.</strong> Testing different phrasing variations can help determine which CTAs and instructional copy resonate best with users, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By carefully crafting language that reduces perceived obligation, digital experiences can feel more user-friendly, ultimately improving conversion rates and overall user satisfaction.</p>

                <h2>Choice Overload</h2>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>Choice overload (also known as overchoice) refers to the phenomenon where having too many options leads to anxiety, confusion, and difficulty making a decision. When the number of options becomes overwhelming, it can cause individuals to feel paralyzed or unsatisfied with their choice, even if they eventually make one.</p>
                    <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>People tend to believe that more choices will lead to a better decision</li>
                        <li>Too many choices can lead to decision fatigue, which makes the user less likely to make a choice at all</li>
                        <li>By reducing the number of choices the user needs to evaluate, the user is more likely to complete the task and to be happier with the outcome</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>As people, we like choices. In fact, we need them--or at least we need to feel like we have them. One example of the way we respond when we feel the perception of losing choices is discussed in Non-Committal Verbiage (link to tab). The problem is that--as much as we like the idea of having all the choices in the world--too many choices can cause a situation of cognitive overload. <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16701-012" target="_blank">A famous study by Sheena Iyengar and Mark Lepper</a> set up two scenarios with shoppers in a grocery store setting. Participants in the first group saw a display with 24 brands of jam, others were saw a display with far fewer--only 6. Given our very human propensity for choices, the enticing variety of the display could be expected to draw more attention, and it did. 60% of the participants in that group with more jams approached to the display to consider a purchase, compared to only 40% of those in the group with fewer options. But there is a still more important factor here. The group with fewer options had a purchase rate that was a whopping 10 times higher than the first group. In short, it had fewer people consider the products, but the end result was significantly higher sales. We may want choices, but they overwhelm us. Other studies confirm this.  People are generally happier going into a setting that offers them a wide variety of choices.  But they end up far less likely to make a choice, and worst of all, they tend to be far less satisfied with their decision. When it comes to choices, the old saying is often true.  Less is more.</p>
</p> In digital design, the portion of users that go from the product page (the "storefront") and begin an application or other process flow is often called the consideration rate. The completion rate then is those that actually finish the flow versus compared to those that start it. The successful process is the one that maximizes the number of people that actually complete the process (and, where applicable, approved). Simplifying the experience by mitigating choice overload is a key strategy to accomplish this. Unfortunately, we're often under a lot of pressure to add any number of links to "related items" and "products/services you might also like."  You can add as much you want--you'll just kill your throughput.</p>
                    <p>So what's a digital product manager to do? The biggest answer is always the hardest--self restraint.  It's clearly counterproductive to throw everything onto the page.  You'll end up worse off for it.  There is good news though.  We don't have to limit ourselves to the single presentation in all cases.  So don't do it.<p>
<p>There is some good news though.  There are techniques that we can use to reduce the cognitive load and make the experience far more effective.  You still can't go crazy, but you can get some great results.  See the discussion on chunking (link to page) to see where we can have situation in which "more is more."</p>
                    </p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <p>Mitigating choice overload in digital design can improve user engagement, increase completion rates, and enhance overall satisfaction. Below are key strategies for effectively managing choice overload in digital experiences:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Limit the number of choices presented or required.</strong> On product pages and applications, we should limit the number of immediately required choices.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incorporate cognitive simplification techniques.</strong> Methods like <a href="#Chunking">Chunking</a> (breaking information into smaller groups) and filtering tools can help users process multiple options more efficiently.</li>
                        <li><strong>Keep the context in mind</strong> when users are just shopping or considering your product, fewer options are better. In a context where the user may be more decisive about moving forward, they may be more tolerant to additional choices.</li>
                        <p>By structuring digital flows to minimize cognitive overload, designers can create smoother, more intuitive user experiences that lead to higher engagement and completion rates.</p>

                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>Chunking is the process of organizing information into manageable, meaningful units, making it easier for the brain to process. When a page is cluttered with too many elements demanding the user’s attention, cognitive overload can set in, making it harder for users to process information. This can lead to choice overload (link) and can increase the likelihood that users may abandon the digital flow. When used effectively, chunking allows designers to introduce more elements when needed without overwhelming the user, which creates a smoother, more intuitive experience. This can enhance the flow of the page and boost engagement, increasing the likelihood that users will stay and complete the process. </p>
                    </p>Key Characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased cognitive load makes the user less likely to proceed </li>
                        <li>Chunking can decrease cognitive load and allow the user to process more details</li>
                        <li>To be effective, it's imperative that the chunks fit logically together</li>

                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Note: streamline this content significantly<p>
                    <p>In digital design, we often follow a simple mantra: that simple is, in fact, better. And the data supports this idea. <a href="https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/" target="_blank">A foundational study by George Miller</a>, who was interested in the effect of cognitive load on memory and processing ability, concluded that we can actually deal fairly well with 5-9 items before cognitive overload impairs our ability to process, although subsequent studies have indicated that this may be closer to 3-5. Some studies go even lower-- <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11515286/" target="_blank">Nelson Cowan</a> puts the number at 4, while <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15724362/" target="_blank">Fernand Gobet and Gary Clarkson</a>,on the more pessimistic side, suggest it may only 2.</p>
                    <p>Regardless of the actual number, chunking, when done well can be an extremely effective method of reducing cognitive load. I had a case study a while ago managing a digital flow for auto loans and was heading up a new program we called the Auto Event, which had the goal of integrating our loan, insurance and car-buying components.  I had a goal that was extremely controversial--I wanted to test a combined product page that integrated the three products together.  We settled on a design with tabs that switched the content between the products depending on which tab was selected.  There was still a lot of concern even as we started the AB testing.  But the results of test were clear and compelling to a degree that surprised even me--and I was the design's most passionate champion. When the numbers were crunched, the cost-benefit analysis was in the millions.  And since we did this all with WCM content changes, the cost was only the time we put into it.  Chunking had clearly been a successful approach. A future iteration added very focused advice sections for car buying, loans, and insurance topics, and showed similar success.</p>
</p>It's important to note that the effort was successful because it was limited in scope to products that were highly conceptually related.  Significantly more topics, especially unrelated in nature, will have the opposite effect.  For more on that scenario, see the topic on Choice Overload (link to page)</p>

                    <p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Only include conceptually related topics and group them logically.</li>
                        <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Offer a smaller number of well-organized navigation options.</li>
                        <li><strong>Application Flows:</strong> Group related inputs into clearly labeled sections.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The key takeaway here is that through chunking, we were able to increase the key messages on the page--which studies show arouses interest on the part of the user--while at the same time decreasing the cognitive load on the user, making for a more pleasant user experience. The end result is a win for everyone.

                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>The exposure effect, more formally known as the mere exposure effect, is a psychological phenomenon in which people tend to develop a more favorable attitude toward things, people, or stimuli that they are exposed to--which could be people, places, ideas, music, or anything else. This effect can take place even when the person is not aware of their change in attitude, and even when they don't even remember seeing the stimuli at all.</p>
                    </p>Key Characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Familiarity leads to liking </li>
                        <li>The effect often works unconsciously </li>
                        <li>Simple exposure triggers the effect, even without any explicit initial judgement</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>There is an old saying that familiarity breeds contempt. Psychologists have shown us that it actually does the opposite--it breeds comfort, and with it, liking.</p>
                    <p>An influential study on Mere Exposure was done by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002210319290055O" target="_blank">Moreland and Beach</a>. The study was in a college classroom setting, in which generally similar female assistants to the researchers attended several classes over the course of the study. The study also included classes that the assistant did not attend at all. At the end of the term, the researchers polled the assistants' classmates to determine their impressions. The results were remarkably consistent. When the assistant was present in the class, the students in the class developed a more favorable impression of her. One other fact to consider--when the assistant was present in the class, she interacted with no one. She arrived, sat, listened and left, giving the other students no real reason to even notice her, much less remember her. This was enough to establish the principle of mere exposure, but the researchers took it a step further. They asked the assistants to randomly attend some classes more than the others, 0, 5, 10 or 15 times. Again, having had no interaction at all with the assistants, the students at each level of increased exposure reported increasingly high favorability towards them. So in addition to the exposure, the frequency or consistency of the exposure were key factors.</p>
                    <p>So there are two components here: first, the recipient needs to have exposure to the material, and second, there needs to be a consistent repetition. In the digital world, there are any number of situations where this can help us or hurt us if we lack consistency. In fact, <a href="https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/press/webinar/The-Impact-of-Brand-Consistency-Report-New_Cover.pdf" target="_blank">a study by Lucidpress</a> estimates that inconsistent messaging can represent a 23% hit to our bottom line. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262448982_Effects_of_strategic_consistency_of_a_message_on_the_consumer" target="_blank">In a related study,</a> Navarro-Bailon notes that consistency does not necessarily mean copy/paste. There can and may even need to be some variation based on channel or other considerations to optimize the approach. The key is that the most important value props are reflected in the messaging, and teams coordinate so that users are not confused by inconsistent or even conflicting messaging.
                    <p> </p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Giving the user easy line of sight to our most important products. The first step, remember, is exposure to the material, which can take place on the company website, marketing and other avenues. </li>
                        <li>Reinforce key benefits. Determine the core messaging for your product, and be consistent with that messaging in such locations as your product page, banner advertisements, email/social marketing, and other user touch points.</li>
                        <li>Pay attention to consistency in branding as well, including color schemes, logos, and related presentation of company materials.</li>
                        <li>Repeat important imagery. A bank that targets the military, for example, will want to expose users to this brand through military imagery, colors, and other branding, and will then want to be consistent with repetition of this theme.</li>

                <h2>Ikea Effect</h2>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>The Ikea Effect is a cognitive bias that suggests that people tend to place higher value on things they have partially created themselves. It's probably clear that the effect is named after the Swedish furniture company <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank"> IKEA </a>, where customers--for better or worse--assemble their own furniture.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Action and effort increases perceived value </li>
                        <li>More effort creates a stronger attachment </li>
                        <li>Interaction strengthens the attachment to the process</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>The Ikea Effect was the subject of a well-known study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2011.08.002" target="_blank">Norton, Mochon, and Ariely (2012)</a> in which participants assembled simple IKEA furniture or were given pre-assembled versions. The results showed that those who assembled the furniture themselves valued it significantly higher than those who received ready-made items, even though the quality was the same. This demonstrated the IKEA effect, where the effort put into something leads to positive associations with the result.</p>
                    <p>A key takeaway of this study is that interaction can provide higher levels of positive feelings, like ownership, comfort and familiarity. When I trained classes in process engineering, for example, there was a common refrain we used--if we don't get the class talking in the first 5 minutes, they won't talk for the entire session. Once the students interacted in the session, they helped build the class in a sense. And with that feelings of comfort and familiarity increase, which made them more responsive to taking the next steps involved with learning the course material. Interaction was the key. With the initial interaction, the students now felt more invested in the class.</p>
                    </p>In digital flows, there are many potential avenues to explore here. I'll give you one. It was a simple calculator directly on the page. With a guess at credit level and a few other pieces of information, it spit out the rate that information would indicate. It's only an estimate and more detail would could show your true rate to be lower (or, of course, higher). While the Digital Product Manager at the time didn't run an AB test to quantify the results, in conversation she indicated there was a clear bump in application starts. The calculator also wasn't a popup. It was just a few fields that replaced the banner at the top. You know the one--it's the big picture of smiling people not looking at the camera, with a start button at lower right. Her version was the extremely simple calculator, result field, and the same start button (also called a "cta" or "call to action" button). All the content below was the same. The only change was a well designed method to encourage interaction and thereby a sense of ownership in the process.<p>
                    <p> It's important to note that this approach enlists another of other principles as well. Reciprocity (add tab for this and link to it) for example--the calculator provided something of value, which elicits in most people a desire to reciprocate in some way. Foot in the door technique (add tab and link) as well, since the calculator becomes a small step towards the bigger step of the application flow. There's even the sunk cost effect, in which expending initial effort makes the user reluctant to break away without seeing the process through.
                    <p> </p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Encourage user interaction early in the process.</strong> Simple interactive elements—such as sliders, estimators, or quizzes—can increase engagement and investment in the experience.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incorporate customization options.</strong> Allowing users to personalize elements (e.g., selecting preferences, adjusting features) fosters a sense of ownership and attachment to the process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use step-by-step input mechanisms.</strong> Breaking a process into small, interactive steps (e.g., a loan calculator or guided form completion) makes users more likely to continue through to completion.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leverage the sunk cost effect to drive follow-through.</strong> When users actively contribute effort—whether by entering initial information, making selections, or interacting with tools—they are more likely to see the process through to the end.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>By designing digital flows that involve user participation, companies can create stronger emotional connections to the process, ultimately increasing conversion rates and user satisfaction.</p>

                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people look to the actions and behaviors of others to determine their own. When individuals are uncertain about what to do, they tend to follow the crowd, assuming that the collective actions of others reflect the correct behavior or decision.</p>
                    <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users are more likely to engage in an action if they see others doing it</li>
                        <li>Testimonials, reviews, and popularity indicators serve as validation signals</li>
                        <li>Effective in reducing hesitation or uncertainty during decision-making</li>

                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>Social proof is particularly influential in digital environments where users cannot physically observe others. Seeing evidence of peer behavior—such as user reviews, ratings, or usage statistics—can strongly influence user decisions and behavior.</p>
                    <p>In financial product contexts, such as credit cards or auto loans, social proof can help establish trust and reduce perceived risk. For instance, prominently displaying that “1 million users have already applied” can reassure users that the product is widely accepted and therefore safe or beneficial.</p>
                    <p>One example involves a digital insurance product where a call to action saw improved conversions after integrating a review carousel from verified users. Despite no changes in pricing or product features, users felt more confident simply because others had vouched for the offering.</p>
                    <p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Show user engagement metrics.</strong> Highlight how many users have applied, purchased, or rated a product.</li>
                        <li><strong>Use testimonials and reviews.</strong> Include quotes, ratings, and feedback from real customers to enhance credibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Incorporate influencer or expert endorsements.</strong> Trust increases when respected figures validate a product or service.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leverage urgency with popularity cues.</strong> Indications like “trending now” or “most popular choice” can encourage quicker decisions.</li>
                        <p>By leveraging social proof, digital interfaces can influence user behavior by tapping into innate social instincts—making it easier for users to trust and engage with financial products and services.</p>

                    <p>The authority principle is a psychological concept where individuals are more likely to comply with requests, follow directions, or accept information when it comes from a figure perceived to be an authority. This principle is rooted in the human tendency to associate credibility, trust, and expertise with authority figures or institutions.</p>
                    <p>Key Characteristics:</p>

                    <p>The authority principle plays a powerful role in shaping user behavior in digital environments. Whether through expert endorsements, institutional branding, or professional tone and design, users are influenced by cues that signal legitimacy and expertise.</p>
                    <p>For example, when designing product pages for financial services such as credit cards or auto loans, featuring expert recommendations or regulatory badges can increase user trust and improve conversions. Similarly, advice content is more effective when attributed to named professionals (e.g., CFPs, loan officers, or medical experts).</p>
                    <p>In one banking application project, the addition of an "Expert Tip" box with the name and credentials of a certified financial planner significantly increased click-through rates on educational content.

    <h2> Reciprocity </h2>
    <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Definition</h3>
        <p> Reciprocity is a social and psychological principle that compels people to return a favor or respond positively when something is given to them first. In digital experiences, this translates to offering users something of value—like helpful content, tools, or insights—before requesting information or commitment. This approach builds trust and increases engagement and conversion rates.</p>
        <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Users are more likely to take action after receiving perceived value first</li>
            <li>Can increase trust and goodwill toward a product or brand</li>
            <li>Works best when the initial “gift” is relevant, timely, and personalized</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p> Reciprocity is a fundamental element of human interaction. Whether it’s a free trial, helpful content, or personalized advice, giving something to users upfront can activate their innate desire to respond in kind. In digital design, this can mean providing mortgage calculators, credit card comparison tools, or insurance coverage checklists before asking users to begin an application. These elements not only improve the user experience but also increase the likelihood that a user will complete a transaction.</p>

        <p>For example, on a bank website offering auto loans, displaying a rate estimator tool or a loan pre-qualification check before requesting personal details can significantly improve user flow. Similarly, credit card product pages that offer personalized card match results based on spending habits create a sense of value and personalization—making the user more likely to continue with the application process.</p>

        <p>Digital design can leverage reciprocation to support trust and reduce drop-offs. Users perceive the experience as beneficial rather than transactional, and that subtle shift builds stronger long-term engagement.</p>

        <p>Digital Applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Offer value upfront.</strong> Provide useful tools or insights (like calculators, guides, or estimates) before asking for commitment or personal data.</li>
            <li><strong>Use smart defaults and personalization.</strong> Make users feel known and supported by offering recommendations based on their behavior or inputs.</li>
            <li><strong>Frame requests within a value exchange.</strong> When asking users for information, pair it with an explanation of the benefit they'll receive.</li>
            <li><strong>Test early gifts versus late requests.</strong> A/B test different flows where users receive value at different stages to measure which creates stronger engagement and conversions.</li>
            <p>By leveraging reciprocation in web design, financial institutions can guide users through applications and product selections more effectively, while building loyalty and trust throughout the experience.</p>

                <p>Inertia, or psychological inertia, refers to the tendency of individuals to stick with a current course of action, decision, or status quo. Once a user begins a process or forms a pattern, they are more likely to continue it. This tendency can be beneficial in digital experiences when leveraged to guide users toward completing tasks.</p>
                <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Users prefer to stay with familiar paths or options even when change would be beneficial</li>

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="subsection">
                <h3>Discussion</h3>
                <p>Psychological inertia is a powerful cognitive principle that can be used to improve user experience in digital product design. Once a user begins a process—like applying for a loan or selecting an insurance plan—they become more likely to follow through if the steps are clear and momentum is maintained. The key is to minimize friction and remove decision fatigue or ambiguity that could cause them to abandon the process.</p>
                <p>Research by Gonzalez and Dutt (2012) demonstrated that users tend to rely on past behavior patterns, repeating previous choices due to cognitive inertia. In a digital context, this means that making initial steps easy and engaging can significantly boost completion rates. For example, if a customer starts applying for a credit card and the flow is well-guided, they are more likely to finish the application—especially if there are subtle cues reinforcing continuity.</p>
                <p>In one case with an insurance application process, we observed that users who clicked through the first few steps—even without fully understanding all details—were highly likely to complete the process. However, when pages required unexpected decisions or seemed to reset progress, drop-offs increased. This indicated that inertia was at work: keep the process moving, and people will often complete it.</p>
                <p>Digital Applications:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use simple, non-threatening steps to start.</strong> Make the first steps of any application or interaction easy and rewarding to initiate forward movement.</li>
                    <li><strong>Minimize friction and interruptions.</strong> Avoid unnecessary questions or choices that could interrupt the inertia.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leverage progress indicators.</strong> The perception of an indefinite process can stall the momentum.</li>
                    <p>By understanding and applying the principles of inertia, digital products can better support users in completing complex tasks—like applying for credit cards, loans, or insurance—by reducing drop-offs and boosting satisfaction through seamless, intuitive experiences.</p>

                    <p>Inattentional blindness is the phenomenon of failing to notice an unexpected object or event that is clearly visible because one's attention is focused on something else. This is a result of our brains' tendency to filter out distracting stimuli that might cause us to lose focus and is also due to our limited attentional resources.  Unfortunately this can also cause the brain to miss important and even obvious factors that can turn out to be highly important.</p>

                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>Before reading further, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo&ab_channel=DanielSimons"> watch this video</a> on selective attention.  The data indicates that only half the viewers get it right.  Here's a hint: don't count the passes made by the players in black shirts.</p>
                    <p>Our brains have become hard-wired to tightly focus on the stimuli it considers most important at the moment. In part this is due to the brain's <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474444/"> limited resources to focus</a> on the information it takes in. At some level it's an evolved part of our <a href="https://www.unh.edu/pacs/panic-understanding-bodys-response-stress">fight or flight</a> response to threats. In fact, studies show that innatentional blindness is cited as a major factor in car-motorcycle accidents, with the additional explanation that the brain is only half as likely to see a motorcycle in a moment of danger than it is to see a car.  The driver looks, but the brain just didn't register the motorcycle in half of the instances in the study.</p>
                    <p>In our digital presentations, the salient takeaways here tend to be design and restraint.  For design, we need to highlight the important elements and to place them in ways that meet the user expectations and behaviors. Placing the "call to action" buttons (CTA's) in expected locations on the page is a good example.  If it is in the wrong place, the user may not see it at all even if the designer thinks is should be obvious.  Similarly, users tend to scroll pages in specific, well documented patterns. Understanding these patterns and placing your key elements accordingly is a critical part of preventing innatentional blindness from hiding what you want the users to see.  Our business partners in the early days wanted tons of links that we placed in the lower right area of our product pages.  Eventually we pulled them all out.  User evaluations showed us that many of our users never even saw them.</p>
</p>Inattentional blindness is magnified by excessive page content.  Restraint is key--as the old saying goes, "less is more." Just like the basketball players in the video, too much information can make it more difficult to see the important elements.  Information overload is really a separate topic, but it is also highly related and important to this discussion as well.</p>
                    <p>Digital Applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Design for clarity and intent.</strong> Determine the critical elements and content from the user's perspective and design to the user's expectations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Determine user behavior.</strong> Place the elements on the page where the user is most likely to quickly see and understand the intent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Guide attention through layout.</strong> Use visual clues to guide the user's attention where it needs to be</li>
                        <li><strong>Test for discoverability.</strong> A/B testing and user walk throughs are effective ways to determine if design elements are effectively seen and understood.</li>
                        <p>By accounting for selective attention in your digital designs, you can reduce user frustration, improve task completion rates, and ensure the users effectively process content and design on your pages.</p>

                <h2>Stroop Effect</h2>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>The Stroop Effect refers to impact on the brain's processing ability verbalize the font color of a word when the word itself describes a different color.  For example, if the word "red" has a font color blue, it will be more difficult and take longer for the person to correctly say the color "blue."</p>
        <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Visually, we easily perceive both the word and the color</li>
            <li>Mentally, the brain is torn between two strong and competing stimuli</li>
            <li>The result is increased difficulty in performing the task of naming the color</li>
        </ul>

                </div>
                <div class="subsection">
                    <h3>Discussion</h3>
                    <p>The Stroop Effect is an interesting and, in some ways, a fun phenomenon.  In the traditional Stroop Effect exercise, the brain experiences a disconnect between the written word and the color of the font used. When you try to say the color, your brain is also reading the word.  If you feel like a kid, try <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html#seffect" target="_blank">this fun exercise</a> on Neuroscience for Kids you can try .  My score was, well, disappointingly slow.  I've seen the Stroop test used in brain training apps, although I should caution that evidence on the effectiveness of brain training apps is not universal.  Interestingly, there are even applications for using what's called an Emotional Stroop Test to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3132173/" target="_blank">evaluate PTSD in the military</a>.  People suffering from PTSD can exhibit slower response when trying to say the font colors used for trauma related words, for example, combat, war, medevac, or crash .</p>
</p>Digitally, the key takeaway is not to publish color words with fonts in contrasting colors.  That's probably obvious.  But we sometimes do things that are startlingly similar, such as the hamburger and snowman icons we use for dropdown menus.  Studies on this go back years, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151023125625/http://exisweb.net/mobile-menu-abtest" target="_blank">this one by Exit</a>, which indicates a 13% hit to performance by using the hamburger icon.  The winning design was to simply replace the hamburger icon with the word "menu".  Other more recent studies by the way indicate the hamburger icon may actually generate as few as half of the clicks that the word "menu" can get.  The reason is simple--when we say "menu", the presentation and what we want the brain to understand are in alignment.  Using the hamburger icon causes a level of cognitive stress that slows down the connection between what the user sees and what we want the user to understand.  It's the reasons behind the Stroop Effect in real life.  </p>
</p><a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html#seffect" target="_blank">Take the test!</a> It's fun.</p> 
 <p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use visual cues that align with user expectations.</strong> Don't make users interpret meanings, it should be immediately clear</li>    
<li><strong>Eliminate presentations that can cause cognitive strain.</strong> A cta in a non-standard place, distracting color schemes, or other unexpected design choices result in strain on the user.</li>
    <li><strong>Minimize competing signals.</strong> Avoid clutter or mixed messages on a page that force the brain to process multiple, conflicting stimuli.</li>
   
</ul>
<p>In essence, the Stroop Effect reminds us that when what users see and what they understand aren’t in sync, performance suffers. Good digital design makes that connection fast, intuitive, and easy—keeping the brain focused on action, not conflict.</p>

<h2>Chunking</h2>
<div class="subsection">
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>Chunking is the process of grouping related information into manageable sections to reduce cognitive load. When used effectively, it helps users absorb content more easily, avoid decision fatigue, and stay engaged.</p>
    <p>Key Characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Too much content at once increases cognitive strain</li>
        <li>Chunking allows users to process more without feeling overwhelmed</li>
        <li>Grouped content should be logically and clearly related</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>In digital design, simplicity is often best—but not always. In one auto loan project, we tested a "combined product page" showing loans, insurance, and vehicle search tools using clear chunked tabs. While this broke from our usual one-product-per-page approach, A/B testing showed surprising results: not only did cross-product traffic increase, but loan applications also rose in the same session. The chunking made the experience smoother without overwhelming users.</p>
    <p>Chunking can be applied in many areas:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Content:</strong> Break text into short sections or lists</li>
        <li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Group links by relevance</li>
        <li><strong>Forms:</strong> Organize inputs into clearly labeled steps</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The goal is to guide users through complex information by making it feel simple—and that leads to better outcomes for both users and businesses.</p>
