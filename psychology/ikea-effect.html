<h1>Ikea Effect</h1>

<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The Ikea Effect is a cognitive bias that suggests that people tend to place higher value on things they have partially created themselves. It's probably clear that the effect is named after the Swedish furniture company <a href="https://www.ikea.com/" target="_blank"> IKEA </a>, where customers--for better or worse--assemble their own furniture.</p>
<ul>
<li>Action and effort increases perceived value </li>
<li>More effort creates a stronger attachment </li>
<li>Interaction strengthens the attachment to the process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The Ikea Effect was the subject of a well-known study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcps.2011.08.002" target="_blank">Norton, Mochon, and Ariely (2012)</a> in which participants assembled simple IKEA furniture or were given pre-assembled versions. The results showed that those who assembled the furniture themselves valued it significantly higher than those who received ready-made items, even though the quality was the same. This demonstrated the IKEA effect, where the effort put into something leads to positive associations with the result.</p>
<p>A key takeaway of this study is that interaction can provide higher levels of positive feelings, like ownership, comfort and familiarity. When I trained classes in process engineering, for example, there was a common refrain we used--if we don't get the class talking in the first 5 minutes, they won't talk for the entire session. Once the students interacted in the session, they helped build the class in a sense. And with that feelings of comfort and familiarity increase, which made them more responsive to taking the next steps involved with learning the course material. Interaction was the key. With the initial interaction, the students now felt more invested in the class.</p>
In digital flows, there are many potential avenues to explore here. I'll give you one. It was a simple calculator directly on the page. With a guess at credit level and a few other pieces of information, it spit out the rate that information would indicate. It's only an estimate and more detail would could show your true rate to be lower (or, of course, higher). While the Digital Product Manager at the time didn't run an AB test to quantify the results, in conversation she indicated there was a clear bump in application starts. The calculator also wasn't a popup. It was just a few fields that replaced the banner at the top. You know the one--it's the big picture of smiling people not looking at the camera, with a start button at lower right. Her version was the extremely simple calculator, result field, and the same start button (also called a "cta" or "call to action" button). All the content below was the same. The only change was a well designed method to encourage interaction and thereby a sense of ownership in the process.<p>
<p> It's important to note that this approach enlists another of other principles as well. Reciprocity (add tab for this and link to it) for example--the calculator provided something of value, which elicits in most people a desire to reciprocate in some way. Foot in the door technique (add tab and link) as well, since the calculator becomes a small step towards the bigger step of the application flow. There's even the sunk cost effect, in which expending initial effort makes the user reluctant to break away without seeing the process through.
                    <p> </p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Encourage user interaction early in the process.</strong> Simple interactive elements—such as sliders, estimators, or quizzes—can increase engagement and investment in the experience.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate customization options.</strong> Allowing users to personalize elements (e.g., selecting preferences, adjusting features) fosters a sense of ownership and attachment to the process.</li>
<li><strong>Use step-by-step input mechanisms.</strong> Breaking a process into small, interactive steps (e.g., a loan calculator or guided form completion) makes users more likely to continue through to completion.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage the sunk cost effect to drive follow-through.</strong> When users actively contribute effort—whether by entering initial information, making selections, or interacting with tools—they are more likely to see the process through to the end.</li>
</ul>
<p>By designing digital flows that involve user participation, companies can create stronger emotional connections to the process, ultimately increasing conversion rates and user satisfaction.</p>
