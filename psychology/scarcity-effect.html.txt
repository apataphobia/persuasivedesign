<h1>Scarcity Effect</h1>

<section class="section" id="Scarcity-Effect">
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>The Scarcity Effect refers to the cognitive bias where people place higher value on items or opportunities that are perceived as limited or rare.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>This effect is deeply rooted in behavioral economics and evolutionary psychology. Scarcity cues can trigger urgency and fear of missing out, making users more likely to take action quickly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Digital Applications</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Use time-limited offers:</strong> Clearly display countdown timers or “only X left” notices to increase urgency.</li>
      <li><strong>Display popularity or demand:</strong> Phrases like “Trending now” or “5 others are viewing this” amplify the effect.</li>
      <li><strong>Be ethical:</strong> Avoid fake scarcity — users will lose trust quickly if the tactic feels manipulative.</li>
    </ul>
