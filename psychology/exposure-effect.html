Title: Exposure Effect

<h1>Exposure Effect</h1>
<section class="section" id="Exposure-Effect">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The exposure effect, more formally known as the mere exposure effect, is a psychological phenomenon in which people tend to develop a more favorable attitude toward things, people, or stimuli that they are exposed to--which could be people, places, ideas, music, or anything else. This effect can take place even when the person is not aware of their change in attitude, and even when they don't even remember seeing the stimuli at all.</p>
Key Characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Familiarity leads to liking </li>
<li>The effect often works unconsciously </li>
<li>Simple exposure triggers the effect, even without any explicit initial judgement</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>There is an old saying that familiarity breeds contempt. Psychologists have shown us that it actually does the opposite--it breeds comfort, and with it, liking.</p>
<p>An influential study on Mere Exposure was done by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/002210319290055O" target="_blank">Moreland and Beach</a>. The study was in a college classroom setting, in which generally similar female assistants to the researchers attended several classes over the course of the study. The study also included classes that the assistant did not attend at all. At the end of the term, the researchers polled the assistants' classmates to determine their impressions. The results were remarkably consistent. When the assistant was present in the class, the students in the class developed a more favorable impression of her. One other fact to consider--when the assistant was present in the class, she interacted with no one. She arrived, sat, listened and left, giving the other students no real reason to even notice her, much less remember her. This was enough to establish the principle of mere exposure, but the researchers took it a step further. They asked the assistants to randomly attend some classes more than the others, 0, 5, 10 or 15 times. Again, having had no interaction at all with the assistants, the students at each level of increased exposure reported increasingly high favorability towards them. So in addition to the exposure, the frequency or consistency of the exposure were key factors.</p>
<h3>Exposure Effect and Digital</h3>
<p>There are two components here: first, the recipient needs to have exposure to the material, and second, there needs to be a consistent repetition. In the digital world, there are any number of situations where this can help us or hurt us if we lack consistency. In fact, <a href="https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/press/webinar/The-Impact-of-Brand-Consistency-Report-New_Cover.pdf" target="_blank">a study by Lucidpress</a> estimates that inconsistent messaging can represent a 23% hit to our bottom line. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262448982_Effects_of_strategic_consistency_of_a_message_on_the_consumer" target="_blank">In a related study,</a> Navarro-Bailon notes that consistency does not necessarily mean copy/paste. There can and may even need to be some variation based on channel or other considerations to optimize the approach. The key is that the most important value props are reflected in the messaging, and teams coordinate so that users are not confused by inconsistent or even conflicting messaging.
                    <p> </p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving the user easy line of sight to our most important products. The first step, remember, is exposure to the material, which can take place on the company website, marketing and other avenues. </li>
<li>Reinforce key benefits. Determine the core messaging for your product, and be consistent with that messaging in such locations as your product page, banner advertisements, email/social marketing, and other user touch points.</li>
<li>Pay attention to consistency in branding as well, including color schemes, logos, and related presentation of company materials.</li>
<li>Repeat important imagery. A bank that targets the military, for example, will want to expose users to this brand through military imagery, colors, and other branding, and will then want to be consistent with repetition of this theme.</li>
</ul>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>
<p>Thanks for reading this overview on the applications of the Exposure Effect to our digital world.  I need your help--specifically, I really need any examples of groups that do this well, and also any that may do this poorly.  I do read these, and I'll update this page to reflect your input.  Thank you in advance!<p>
