<h1>Social Proof</h1>
<section class="section" id="Social Proof">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Social proof is a psychological phenomenon where people look to the actions and behaviors of others to determine how they should react.  This can take the form of conforming to the reactions of others in a given situation, choosing options they perceive are preferred by others, virtually anything we come across in life.  Although this is an ever present influence in our lives, it is especially pronounced in situations of ambiguity, stress, or uncertainty. </p>
<p>Key Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users are more likely to engage in an action if they see others doing it or believe that it is the socially acceptable decision</li>
<li>The effect is especially strong if the individual is uncertain or in an ambiguous situation, or when there is pressure for a rapid decision</li>
<li>It is an evolved trait to reduce hesitation or uncertainty during decision-making</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>We've all been in new situations.  When you started a new job, you may have watched how formally or informally your peers interacted with leaders and patterned your own actions after what you saw.  Or in a meeting, if you see others actively taking notes, you might want to do the same.  Often the effects of social proof are less conscious.  If your work group or social group all wear smart watches, or use a particular brand, you may find yourself with a strong desire for what you see others using, even if you never were interested in it before.  This is social proof. </p>
</p>Some of the most famous social proof studies were conducted by Solomon Asch in the 1950s.  <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=DGjQAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">His initial 1951 study<a> was almost shocking in the effect it showed.  Asch gave multiple groups of 8 participants 2 cards, one with a single line, the second with three lines, one of which was clearly shorter than the others, one of which was clearly longer. In other words, the correct answer was obvious, and it was no surprise that the control group got nearly 100% correct. In the test groups, however, a trick was played--only 1 person was an actual participant while all the others were confederates that were instructed to give a specific and clearly wrong answer.  Still, we might reasonably expect only a few people to be tricked on a question that was designed to be so easy.  It turns out that 75% of the participants chose the obviously wrong line at least once.  And many did so multiple times, with a smaller but not tiny number of participants did so on nearly every test. Asch even tried exaggerating the differences in line lengths, but no matter how exaggerated the differences were, participants continued to be swayed by the confederates. The reasons they gave may be even more telling--most assumed they were missing something that the others somehow knew, so they switched assuming the group must be right.  Others however actually convinced themselves that they could actually see that incorrect line matched the test line. And one other group knew all along that the majority was wrong--they just wanted to fit in.  There is good news though.  Asch found in a <a href="https://pdodds.w3.uvm.edu/teaching/courses/2009-08UVM-300/docs/others/everything/asch1955a.pdf">followup study<a> that if one person--only one--among the many confederates to give the right answer, the effect was virtually negated.  Participants gave the correct answers in 95% of those cases.</p>
</p>There are many really interesting studies on this.  In one study, researcher found that social proof was an extremely effective method <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/17118005_Vicarious_Extinction_of_Avoidance_Behavior">to treat children's fear of dogs<a>. In another, participants showed they would actually <a href="https://learn.academy4sc.org/video/the-smoky-room-experiment-trust-your-instincts/"> remain passive in a room filling with smoke<a> if there were others present that showed no concern.  In a study by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cialdini">Robert_Cialdini<a>, the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/pefo/index.htm"> Arizona National Petrified Forest<a> tested "shaming" language that decried the many visitors that took the petrified rocks from the park.  It backfired--using that verbiage, thefts nearly tripled over test versions.  As I mentioned in <a href="https://apataphobia.github.io/persuasivedesign/psychology/non-committal-verbiage.html">Non-Committal Verbiage"<a>, words matter.  In this case, these words focused on the wrong behavior, and social proof took over.</p>
<h3>Social Proof and Digital</h3>
<p>There are many examples of how social proof is used digitally, although trust also becomes an important factor.  Reviews are a common and still effective use of social proof, as you can see in any <a href="https:www.amazon.com">Amazon<a> product. In response to users' that have become suspicious of fake reviews, Amazon and others have added a "verified purchaser" designation which has <a href="https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/sage/factors-enhancing-efficacy-of-b2c-sites-in-online-virtual-environment-1fsa8qradS"> proven effective<a> in reengaging user trust in those reviews. Netflix started out famous for its recommendation algorithms but opaque when it came to actual viewership.  Now, however, the company prominently displays the most highly viewed movies and shows on its platform.  The reason is simple--social proof was found to be a stronger driver than trust in the Netflix algorithm. <a href="https:www.usa.gov">Usa.gov<a> conducted a test that added a social proof icon to promote eID usage.  In this study, they simply added a comment informing the user that "77% chose this option (referring to the eID)," and found that this social proof prompted users on the page to choose the eID option at a rate 4x higher than in the control version. And in a banking study, simply adding a reference to JD Powers awards given to that banking product was shown to increase conversion by 4% over the previous text on that page.</p>
<p>The list goes on and on. <a href="https:www.hotels.com">Hotels.com<a> and similar sites powerfully combine social proof with the scarcity principle, telling you how many people have recently viewed a room the user is considering.  Similarly, <a href="https:www.ebay.com">Ebay<a> tells you how many are watching or following an item you may look at. <a href="https:www.asana.com">Asana<a> tells you on its splash page that "85% of Fortune 100 companies choose Asana" (I can't validate that claim of course). Social proof is a powerful force.  And it seems virtually everyone is using it. </p>
<p>Digital Applications</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Show user engagement metrics.</strong> Highlight how many users have applied, purchased, or rated a product.</li>
<li><strong>Use testimonials and reviews.</strong> Include quotes, ratings, and feedback from real customers to enhance credibility.</li>
<li><strong>Incorporate expert endorsements or awards.</strong> Trust increases when respected figures validate a product or service.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage urgency with popularity cues.</strong> Indications like “trending now” or “most popular choice” can encourage quicker decisions.</li>
<p>By leveraging social proof, digital interfaces can influence user behavior by tapping into innate social instincts—making it easier for users to trust and engage with products and services.</p>
</ul>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>
<p>Thanks for reading this overview on the applications of Social Proof to our digital world.  I need your help--specifically, I really need any examples of groups that do this well, and also any that may do this poorly.  I do read these, and I'll update this page to reflect your input.  Thank you in advance!<p>
