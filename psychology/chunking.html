<h2>Chunking</h2>
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Chunking is the process of organizing information into manageable, meaningful units, making it easier for the brain to process. When a page is cluttered with too many elements demanding the userâ€™s attention, cognitive overload can set in, making it harder for users to process information. This can lead to choice overload (link) and can increase the likelihood that users may abandon the digital flow. When used effectively, chunking allows designers to introduce more elements when needed without overwhelming the user, which creates a smoother, more intuitive experience. This can enhance the flow of the page and boost engagement, increasing the likelihood that users will stay and complete the process. </p>
Key Characteristics:
<ul>
<li>Increased cognitive load makes the user less likely to proceed </li>
<li>Chunking can decrease cognitive load and allow the user to process more details</li>
<li>To be effective, it's imperative that the chunks fit logically together</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Note: streamline this content significantly<p>
<p>In digital design, we often follow a simple mantra: that simple is, in fact, better. And the data supports this idea. <a href="https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller/" target="_blank">A foundational study by George Miller</a>, who was interested in the effect of cognitive load on memory and processing ability, concluded that we can actually deal fairly well with 5-9 items before cognitive overload impairs our ability to process, although subsequent studies have indicated that this may be closer to 3-5. Some studies go even lower-- <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11515286/" target="_blank">Nelson Cowan</a> puts the number at 4, while <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15724362/" target="_blank">Fernand Gobet and Gary Clarkson</a>,on the more pessimistic side, suggest it may only 2.</p>
<p>Regardless of the actual number, chunking, when done well can be an extremely effective method of reducing cognitive load. I had a case study a while ago managing a digital flow for auto loans and was heading up a new program we called the Auto Event, which had the goal of integrating our loan, insurance and car-buying components.  I had a goal that was extremely controversial--I wanted to test a combined product page that integrated the three products together.  We settled on a design with tabs that switched the content between the products depending on which tab was selected.  There was still a lot of concern even as we started the AB testing.  But the results of test were clear and compelling to a degree that surprised even me--and I was the design's most passionate champion. When the numbers were crunched, the cost-benefit analysis was in the millions.  And since we did this all with WCM content changes, the cost was only the time we put into it.  Chunking had clearly been a successful approach. A future iteration added very focused advice sections for car buying, loans, and insurance topics, and showed similar success.</p>
</p>It's important to note that the effort was successful because it was limited in scope to products that were highly conceptually related.  Significantly more topics, especially unrelated in nature, will have the opposite effect.  For more on that scenario, see the topic on Choice Overload (link to page)</p>
<p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Content:</strong> Only include conceptually related topics and group them logically.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation:</strong> Offer a smaller number of well-organized navigation options.</li>
<li><strong>Application Flows:</strong> Group related inputs into clearly labeled sections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key takeaway here is that through chunking, we were able to increase the key messages on the page--which studies show arouses interest on the part of the user--while at the same time decreasing the cognitive load on the user, making for a more pleasant user experience. The end result is a win for everyone.
