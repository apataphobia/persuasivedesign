<h2>Optimism Bias</h2>
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Optimism bias is the tendency for people to believe that they are less likely to experience negative events and more likely to experience positive outcomes. It’s a cognitive bias where individuals expect things to go well, often overlooking potential risks or challenges.This tendency encourages confidence but can sometimes lead to being overly hopeful about an outcome and therefore may cause the user to overlook potential negative outcomes.</p>
<p>Key Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can lead users to believe they are finished when there may be steps left to take</li>
<li>Optimistic assumptions can cause users to miss important steps or details in a process</li>
<li>rewrite this line</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Optimism bias is a common tendency that has impacted all of us at one time or another. If you've ever encountered a disappointing result and, looking back, it seems that some fairly obvious steps might have avoided this situation, you have been the victim of optimism bias. Most students will at one time or another wonder why they thought they were better prepared for a test than their grades might reflect. We probably all have examples of situations in which we have paid a price for being unrealistically optimistic.
                    <p>
<p>Neil Weinstein conducted <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=8ea252384f36afdfc4ff6d5c3786aa6afcb5db6bz" target="_blank">a major study in 1980</a> that demonstrated the tendency of individuals to believe that they are less likely to experience negative events (such as illness or accidents) and more likely to experience positive events (such as good health or success) compared to others. He noted in a second study that people "are unrealistically optimistic because they focus on factors that improve their own chances of achieving desirable outcomes" and fail to consider the factors that may instead cause failures. Because optimism bias leads us to believe that success is pretty much "in the bag," so to speak, it causes us to miss or even ignore signs that more needs to be done.
                    <p>
<p>Digitally, we fall into this trap often simply by not looking at the flow from the user's point of view. Medlin, rewrite the rest of this--&gt;I can describe from experience a situation with a group that provided auto loans. We were trying to solve a common problem in this field, specifically that approved customers often did not get the loans. This could be for many reasons that go beyond the digital design, but our focus was on the changes within our digital purview. In looking at the screenshots, a potential problem became clear. The approval screen had all the right elements: a notice of approval, pleasing text and font color, a bright picture of a big truck on a mountainside, and below instructions to select the loan term. The selection of the loan term will determine the final rate, which will be different for say a 36 or 48 or any other section of months for the loan term. There were two issues here. First, the loan term selection was all "below the fold" or not shown in the initial page load. This alone would not have been a problem since most pages have content that does not fit on the initial page load. The real problem here was that the design inadvertently cut off right below the graphic, with no indication that there was more content to be viewed. It looked initially to the user that it was simply a confirmation screen like any other and the message that "You're approved!" Sophisticated users might know that a loan term was needed and wonder where the selection was to be made. But newer users--and maybe even some more experienced users--could easily be sidelined by optimism bias. They saw what they were hoping for--an exciting message of approval and a "big honkin' truck" (as I called it) that pushed the needed content below the fold.
                    <p>
<p>An important note here is that people were still not convinced. Even designers dismissed the idea, feeling certain that surely people know to scroll. But AB testing bore it out. As Weinstein alluded to in his study, factors that contributed to the optimistic result that people wanted to see--in this case a successful conclusion to the application--kept some users from even looking to see that the important last step still needed to be completed.</p>
</p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure key actions are clearly visible.</strong> Important steps should never be hidden "below the fold" without clear visual cues that additional action is required.</li>
<li><strong>Use explicit progress indicators.</strong> A clear, step-by-step progress bar helps users understand exactly where they are in a process and what remains to be done.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforce next steps with clear messaging.</strong> Instead of assuming users will seek out additional steps, use prominent calls to action and instructional cues to guide them forward.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage user testing and data.</strong> A/B testing can reveal where optimism bias may be causing drop-off points, allowing for iterative design improvements that ensure users complete critical steps.</li>
<p>By addressing optimism bias in digital applications, we can create more effective user experiences that prevent premature disengagement and improve overall process completion.</p>
</ul>
