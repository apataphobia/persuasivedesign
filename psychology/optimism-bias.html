<h1>Optimism Bias</h1>
<section class="section" id="Optimism Bias">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Optimism bias is the tendency for people to believe that they are less likely to experience negative events and more likely to experience positive outcomes. Itâ€™s a cognitive bias where individuals expect things to go well, and because of this they often overlook potential risks or challenges, or miss other important information.This tendency encourages confidence but can sometimes lead to being overly hopeful about an outcome and therefore may cause the user to ignore necessary next steps.</p>
<p>Key Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users believe they are finished when there may be steps left to take</li>
<li>Important information, such as the need to look out for and respond to potential notifications, may be missed</li>
<li>This effect can impact us even when we are not entirely conscious of it</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Optimism bias is a common tendency that has impacted all of us at one time or another. If you've ever encountered a disappointing result and, looking back, it seems that some fairly obvious steps might have avoided this situation, you have been the victim of optimism bias. Most students will at one time or another wonder why they thought they were better prepared for a test than their grades might reflect. We probably all have examples of situations in which we have paid a price for being unrealistically optimistic.
                    <p>
<p>Neil Weinstein conducted <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=8ea252384f36afdfc4ff6d5c3786aa6afcb5db6bz" target="_blank">a major study in 1980</a> that demonstrated the tendency of individuals to believe that they are less likely to experience negative events (such as illness or accidents) and more likely to experience positive events (such as good health or success) compared to others. He noted in a second study that people "are unrealistically optimistic because they focus on factors that improve their own chances of achieving desirable outcomes" and fail to consider the factors that may instead cause failures. Because optimism bias leads us to believe that success is pretty much "in the bag," so to speak, it causes us to miss or even ignore signs that more needs to be done.  Tail Sharot and fellow researchers found in <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=8ea252384f36afdfc4ff6d5c3786aa6afcb5db6bz" target="_blank">their followup study on Optimism Bias</a> that the our minds overweight even mildly optimistic signals. Participants were asked how likely they were to come across a number of negative situations, then told the actual probabilities.  When the results were more optimistic, even to a small degree, they later reported more optimistic assessments on the likelihood of that particular scenario.  However, when the actual probabilities were negative, their later responses were almost unchanged.  Perhaps more importantly--the participants seemed relatively unaware of the discrepancies between the more pessimistic data they received and the overly optimistic report they gave in the second assessment.  We are in many ways hardwired to assume the positive, even to the degree that don't even notice the impact.<p>

<p>Digitally, we fall into this trap often simply by not looking at the flow from the user's point of view. There are a lot of examples of this.  The most extreme example I saw was the at the end of a loan application.  The approved user would see a big, shiny truck parked on a mountain road with majestic views behind it, with big, all cap letters that said "YOU'RE APPROVED!"  It was very inspiring.  The problem was that on desktop view (by far the most common display at the time) and a browser set at default zoom (the most common setting), this image perfectly took up the entire view above the fold.  There is however another very critical step--the selection of the length of the loan, a critical choice that will determine your final interest rate and monthly payment--which was entirely below the fold, again with an initial display that visually gave the impression that the process was done. It was the perfect setup for Optimism Bias to take hold.  Not everyone was convinced, though.  There was a lot of discussion about how important or trivial the fold is, surely most people knows to scroll, most people know they need to choose a loan term, and so forth.  How do we determine if this is a problem worth solving? AB testing of course. In this case we tested the control against a version that had a similar image but reduced in height.  This ensured that the cutoff point of the browser at standard zoom displayed the top portion of the term choice boxes, which gave a strong and immediate visual cue to scroll down.  And the AB test confirmed it--the challenger in this case showed statistically significant improvement over the former current state view.<p>

<p>To the thought by the way that most people know to scroll--I'm sure they do! But tendencies like Optimism Bias have a strong and subconscious impact.  As <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=8ea252384f36afdfc4ff6d5c3786aa6afcb5db6bz" target="_blank">Weinstein<a> alluded, factors that contributed to the optimistic result that people wanted to see--in this case an approval notification--kept some users from even looking to see that the important last step still needed to be completed. And when you have users that generate page hits in the hundreds of thousands and into the millions, factors like this will definitely improve your throughput.</p>

</p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ensure key actions are clearly visible.</strong> Important steps should never be hidden "below the fold" without clear visual cues that additional action is required.</li>
<li><strong>Use explicit progress indicators.</strong> A clear, step-by-step progress bar helps users understand exactly where they are in a process and what remains to be done.</li>
<li><strong>Reinforce next steps with clear messaging.</strong> Instead of assuming users will seek out additional steps, use prominent calls to action and instructional cues to guide them forward.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage user testing and data.</strong> A/B testing can reveal where optimism bias may be causing drop-off points, allowing for iterative design improvements that ensure users complete critical steps.</li>
<p>By addressing optimism bias in digital applications, we can create more effective user experiences that prevent premature disengagement and improve overall process completion.</p>
</ul>
