<h2>Non-Committal Verbiage</h2>
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Non-committal verbiage refers to language that avoids the feel of obligation. It involves using words or phrases that don't fully commit to following a specific path. Examples of non-committal verbiage include phrases like “Get Started” rather than “Apply Now.” Committal verbiage conveys the feel or impression--real or imagined--that the user may be somehow locked in to a given path. Non-committal verbiage avoids any subtle or implied message of obligation. </p>
<p>Key Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Makes actions feel exploratory rather than binding</li>
<li>Committal language can convey the perception of obligation, which can feel like a loss of options</li>
<li>Reducing perceived commitment can make the user feel more comfortable with the process, and more likely to proceed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>As the old saying goes, words matter. Dr. Youyou Wu would certainly say so. She ran a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1418680112" target="_blank">a study to on Facebook posts</a> to determine how closely she could measure a person's personality traits based on the content of the posts that were liked by the participants. The results were both fascinating and some combination of scary and creepy. Dr. Wu found that the analysis program could evaluate the participants personality type better than actual humans in the participants' social circles. It only took 10 posts to gage a person's personality better than coworkers at the participants' offices were able to do. With 70 posts, the algorithm was able to beat the assessments of the participants' close friends or roommates. At the range of 250-300 posts, the algorithm is more accurate than a participants' own spouses.</p>
<p>More to the point here, people often experience resistance to language that conveys the perception of a tone of command. We can feel a loss of control and an almost subconscious resistance. There's a lot of studies on this with public service messaging. For example, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1977-01216-001" target="_blank">a study by Pennebaker and Sanders</a> tested a strongly worded command to not write graffiti in a bathroom versus an alternative of asking users to "please" not write graffiti. The commanding verbiage resulted in significantly more (italicize) graffiti than the non-committal request. In a similar <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.1991.tb00461.x" target="_blank">In a similar study by Bensley and Wu</a> on messages to reduce drinking, they also found that the softer or neutral wording in the test messages were significantly more effective in curbing excess drinking than the more strongly worded messages.
                    <p> </p> The example I gave above in the definition is from actual testing I did on this concept. AB testing several products, the non-committal verbiage beat things like "Apply Now" and other similar Call to Action (CTA) content by a significant margin. The results were remarkably consistent. "Apply Now" implies both a command (tone) and that user is expected to complete the application (loss of choice). "Get Started" is softer (more neutral tone), and leaves the question of completion to the user (more choice). 

In another test on a membership flow, the standard committal CTA verbiage "Join Now" was tested against the softer verbiage "Check Eligibility." In this study, the softer verbiage increased clicks to the informational page by 10%, and clicks into the actual membership flow were up by 5% over control--phenomenal results for a simple change to the start button.

This is an easy change to make and I guarantee it will have an impact. </p>
Digital Applications:
<ul>
<li><strong>Use softer, open-ended calls to action (CTAs).</strong> Replace high-commitment phrases like "Apply Now" with "Get Started" or "Learn More" to encourage users to engage without feeling locked in.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid authoritative or commanding language.</strong> Strongly worded instructions can create psychological resistance. Instead, use neutral or inviting language to guide users through the process.</li>
<li><strong>Frame actions as user-driven choices.</strong> Emphasizing autonomy—such as “Explore Options” rather than “Choose Now”—can increase user comfort and willingness to proceed.</li>
<li><strong>Leverage A/B testing to refine messaging.</strong> Testing different phrasing variations can help determine which CTAs and instructional copy resonate best with users, leading to higher engagement and conversion rates.</li>
</ul>
<p>By carefully crafting language that reduces perceived obligation, digital experiences can feel more user-friendly, ultimately improving conversion rates and overall user satisfaction.</p>
