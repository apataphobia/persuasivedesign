<h1>About PersuasiveDesign</h1>

<p>This site is committed to presenting psychology and neuroscience concepts and their applications to making effective digital flows that benefit both the business and the user.  This is a research and data-driven approach, and every concept will have solid, proven background studies on the topic and then move into practical examples of digital application.  Where applicable, I'll include examples that I have seen proven out through personal experience and observation.</p>

<p>I’m <strong>Chris Medlin</strong>, a data-focused UX Certified Digital Product Manager and Certified Six Sigma Master Black Belt Process Engineer with a passion for using research, UX insights, and performance data to create digital experiences that actually matter to users.</p>

<p>With over <strong>13 years of experience</strong> in digital product management — and more than <strong>15 years in process engineering</strong> — across a range of sectors including Healthcare, auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, and consumer loans, I hope to use experiences of process improvement and digital transformation to help others.</p>

<p>While you're here, you can help me out! Leave a comment on topics you find particularly interesting.  Also, I need your examples.  Let me know of digital presentations that do particularly well on any given topic, or also of any situations in which a topic here could improve someone's digital presence.  I would really appreciate it.</p>
