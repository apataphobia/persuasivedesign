<p>Thanks for reading this overview on the applications of Memory Reconsolidation to our digital world.  I need your help--specifically, I really need any examples of groups that do this well, and also any that may do this poorly.  I do read these, and I'll update this page to reflect your input.  Thank you in advance!<p>
