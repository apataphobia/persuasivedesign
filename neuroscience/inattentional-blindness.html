Title: Inattentional Blindness

<h1>Inattentional Blindness</h1>
<section class="section" id="Inattentional-Blindness">
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>Inattentional blindness is the phenomenon of failing to notice an unexpected object or event that is clearly visible because one's attention is focused on something else. This is a result of our brains' tendency to filter out distracting stimuli that might cause us to lose focus and is also due to our limited attentional resources.  Unfortunately this can also cause the brain to miss important and even obvious factors that can turn out to be highly important.</p>
<p>Key Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full attention is generally applied only to a narrow segment of our field of vision</li>
<li>Our brain can fail to register important elements even when it seems otherwise obvious</li>
<li>Once the brain determines a stimuli is not relevant, it may be more difficult to see the stimuli even with persistent effort</li>
</ul>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Before reading further, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo&amp;ab_channel=DanielSimons"> watch this video</a> on selective attention.  The data indicates that only half the viewers get it right.  Here's a hint: don't count the passes made by the players in black shirts.</p>
<p>Our brains have become hard-wired to tightly focus on the stimuli it considers most important at the moment. In part this is due to the brain's <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3474444/"> limited resources to focus</a> on the information it takes in. At some level it's an evolved part of our <a href="https://www.unh.edu/pacs/panic-understanding-bodys-response-stress">fight or flight</a> response to threats. In fact, studies show that inatentional blindness is cited as a major factor in car-motorcycle accidents, with the additional explanation that the brain is only half as likely to see a motorcycle in a moment of danger than it is to see a car.  The driver looks, but the brain just didn't register the motorcycle in half of the instances in the study.</p>

<h3>Inattentional Blindness and Digital</h3>
<p>In our digital presentations, the salient takeaways here tend to be design and restraint.  For design, we need to highlight the important elements and to place them in ways that meet the user expectations and behaviors. Placing the "call to action" buttons (CTA's) in expected locations on the page is a good example.  If it is in the wrong place, the user may not see it at all even if the designer thinks is should be obvious.  Similarly, users tend to scroll pages in specific, well documented patterns. Understanding these patterns and placing your key elements accordingly is a critical part of preventing innatentional blindness from hiding what you want the users to see.  Our business partners in the early days wanted tons of links that we placed in the lower right area of our product pages.  Eventually we pulled them all out.  User evaluations showed us that many of our users never even saw them.</p>
Inattentional blindness is magnified by excessive page content.  Restraint is key--as the old saying goes, "less is more." Just like the basketball players in the video, too much information can make it more difficult to see the important elements.  Information overload is really a separate topic, but it is also highly related and important to this discussion as well.
<p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design for clarity and intent.</strong> Determine the critical elements and content from the user's perspective and design to the user's expectations.</li>
<li><strong>Determine user behavior.</strong> Place the elements on the page where the user is most likely to quickly see and understand the intent.</li>
<li><strong>Guide attention through layout.</strong> Use visual clues to guide the user's attention where it needs to be</li>
<li><strong>Test for discoverability.</strong> A/B testing and user walk throughs are effective ways to determine if design elements are effectively seen and understood.</li>
<p>By accounting for selective attention in your digital designs, you can reduce user frustration, improve task completion rates, and ensure the users effectively process content and design on your pages.</p>
</ul>

<h3>User Feedback</h3>
<p>Thanks for reading this overview on the applications of Inattentional Blindness to our digital world.  I need your help--specifically, I really need any examples of groups that do this well, and also any that may do this poorly.  I do read these, and I'll update this page to reflect your input.  Thank you in advance!<p>
