<h2>Stroop Effect</h2>
<div class="subsection">
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>The Stroop Effect refers to impact on the brain's processing ability verbalize the font color of a word when the word itself describes a different color.  For example, if the word "red" has a font color blue, it will be more difficult and take longer for the person to correctly say the color "blue."</p>
<p>Key Characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visually, we easily perceive both the word and the color</li>
<li>Mentally, the brain is torn between two strong and competing stimuli</li>
<li>The result is increased difficulty in performing the task of naming the color</li>
</ul>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>The Stroop Effect is an interesting and, in some ways, a fun phenomenon.  In the traditional Stroop Effect exercise, the brain experiences a disconnect between the written word and the color of the font used. When you try to say the color, your brain is also reading the word.  If you feel like a kid, try <a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html#seffect" target="_blank">this fun exercise</a> on Neuroscience for Kids you can try .  My score was, well, disappointingly slow.  I've seen the Stroop test used in brain training apps, although I should caution that evidence on the effectiveness of brain training apps is not universal.  Interestingly, there are even applications for using what's called an Emotional Stroop Test to <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3132173/" target="_blank">evaluate PTSD in the military</a>.  People suffering from PTSD can exhibit slower response when trying to say the font colors used for trauma related words, for example, combat, war, medevac, or crash .</p>
Digitally, the key takeaway is not to publish color words with fonts in contrasting colors.  That's probably obvious.  But we sometimes do things that are startlingly similar, such as the hamburger and snowman icons we use for dropdown menus.  Studies on this go back years, such as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20151023125625/http://exisweb.net/mobile-menu-abtest" target="_blank">this one by Exit</a>, which indicates a 13% hit to performance by using the hamburger icon.  The winning design was to simply replace the hamburger icon with the word "menu".  Other more recent studies by the way indicate the hamburger icon may actually generate as few as half of the clicks that the word "menu" can get.  The reason is simple--when we say "menu", the presentation and what we want the brain to understand are in alignment.  Using the hamburger icon causes a level of cognitive stress that slows down the connection between what the user sees and what we want the user to understand.  It's the reasons behind the Stroop Effect in real life.  
<a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html#seffect" target="_blank">Take the test!</a> It's fun.
<p>Digital Applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Use visual cues that align with user expectations.</strong> Don't make users interpret meanings, it should be immediately clear</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate presentations that can cause cognitive strain.</strong> A cta in a non-standard place, distracting color schemes, or other unexpected design choices result in strain on the user.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize competing signals.</strong> Avoid clutter or mixed messages on a page that force the brain to process multiple, conflicting stimuli.</li>
</ul>
<p>In essence, the Stroop Effect reminds us that when what users see and what they understand aren’t in sync, performance suffers. Good digital design makes that connection fast, intuitive, and easy—keeping the brain focused on action, not conflict.</p>
