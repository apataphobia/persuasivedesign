<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi there — I’m <strong>Christopher Medlin</strong>, a data-focused Product Manager and Process Engineer with a passion for using research, UX insights, and performance data to create digital experiences that actually matter to users.</p>

<p>With over <strong>13 years of experience</strong> in digital product management — and more than <strong>15 years in process engineering</strong> — I’ve worked across a range of sectors including auto and home insurance, car buying, mortgages, consumer loans, and credit cards. Whether it's leading agile teams, shaping strategic product roadmaps, or running A/B tests that move the needle, I'm all about delivering measurable impact.</p>

<p>I’m also a <strong>Certified UX Practitioner</strong> and <strong>Six Sigma Master Black Belt</strong>, so I naturally gravitate toward structured problem-solving, data-driven decisions, and process optimization that improves both the customer experience and the bottom line.</p>

<p>Collaboration is at the heart of how I work — I’ve led cross-functional teams, partnered with stakeholders across lines of business, and worked closely with executive leadership to push forward meaningful change.</p>

<p>If you want a deeper dive into my experience and background, feel free to check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-l-medlin/" target="_blank">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
